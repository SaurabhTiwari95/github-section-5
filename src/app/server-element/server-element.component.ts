    This property will be imoprted from @angular/core.
    
    We can overwrite the view Encapsulation property on styles by adding the above property,so that this component
    will not use the ViewEncapsulation of styles the other Components will still use it where we can see the strange 
    attributes,but now when we define any styles in this component(in the css file of this component) they will get applied globally.
    
    There are three modes of this property , they are:  
    1.Emulated(default behavior)
    2.Native(Supported by the browsers who support shadow DOM otherwise use None)
    3.None (overwrites the View Encapsulation styles)
